# GeyserCompat

Make Geyser-Spigot run on 1.12.2 paper server.

This plugin needs a custom 1.12.2 paper server which adds ServerLoadEvent and BlockData. I have made one based on [beast](https://github.com/HomoMC/Beast), a Minecraft Paper 1.12.2 fork which aims to offer extreme performance and stability. You can download it from [libs/beast-1.12.2.jar](https://github.com/DawningW/GeyserCompat/blob/master/libs/beast-1.12.2.jar).
